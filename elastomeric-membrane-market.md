<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Elastomeric Membrane Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Sheet</li><li>Liquid Applied</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The elastomeric membrane market is primarily divided into two types: sheet and liquid-applied membranes. Sheet membranes are pre-manufactured products that are rolled out and adhered to surfaces, offering robust waterproofing and protection. In contrast, liquid-applied membranes are applied in a liquid state, forming a seamless, flexible barrier once cured. Both types are used in construction and waterproofing applications, providing effective solutions for roofs, foundations, and other structures by preventing water infiltration and ensuring durability against environmental elements.</p></p>
