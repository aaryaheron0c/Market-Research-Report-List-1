<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Embedded Optical Fiber Polarizer Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>SM Type</li><li>PM Type</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Embedded Optical Fiber Polarizer market is primarily categorized into two types: SM (Single-Mode) and PM (Polarization-Maintaining). SM type polarizers are designed for single-mode fibers, allowing light of a specific polarization state to pass while blocking others, ideal for applications requiring high precision and low loss. PM type polarizers, on the other hand, are used in polarization-maintaining fibers, which preserve the polarization state over long distances, making them essential for advanced telecommunication and sensor applications where maintaining polarization is critical.</p></p>
