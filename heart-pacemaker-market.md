<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Heart Pacemaker Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Implantable Heart Pacemaker</li><li>External Heart Pacemaker</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The heart pacemaker market is primarily divided into two types: implantable and external heart pacemakers. Implantable heart pacemakers are surgically inserted under the skin to regulate heartbeats in patients with arrhythmias, providing long-term management. In contrast, external heart pacemakers are used temporarily, often in emergency or hospital settings, to manage patients' heart rhythms until a more permanent solution is found. Both types play crucial roles in ensuring effective cardiac function and improving patient outcomes in various clinical scenarios.</p></p>
