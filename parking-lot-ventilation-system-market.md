<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Parking Lot Ventilation System Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Axial Fan</li><li>Jet Fan</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Parking lot ventilation systems are essential for maintaining air quality and safety in enclosed or underground spaces. The market primarily features two types: axial fans and jet fans. Axial fans move air parallel to the fan axis, providing efficient airflow across large areas and maintaining uniform ventilation. In contrast, jet fans generate high-velocity air jets that effectively control smoke and heat during emergencies by directing it towards designated exhaust points. Both systems are crucial for enhancing occupant safety and regulatory compliance.</p></p>
