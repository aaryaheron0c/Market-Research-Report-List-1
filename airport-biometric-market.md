<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Airport Biometric Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Contact</li><li>Contactless</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The airport biometric market is divided into two main types: contact and contactless. Contact biometrics require physical interaction, such as fingerprint scanners or iris recognition devices that necessitate touching the hardware. In contrast, contactless biometrics utilize technologies like facial recognition and voice recognition, allowing passengers to be verified without physical touch. Both market types aim to enhance security and streamline passenger flow, but contactless solutions generally offer greater convenience and faster processing times, making them increasingly popular in modern airports.</p></p>
